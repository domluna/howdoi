Here is a poem about the stars:

Twinkling Lights in the Night Sky

Glittering gems in the endless expanse,
Shimmering specks that dance.
Distant suns, burning bright,
Illuminating the dark of night.

Celestial wonders, so far away,
Guiding us through each passing day.
Sparkling sentinels, ever-present,
Reminding us of the universe's grandeur.

Constellations, ancient and true,
Weaving stories, just for you.
Beacons of hope, in times of strife,
Reminding us of the wonder of life.

The stars, a canvas of endless delight,
Painting the sky with their ethereal light.
A symphony of celestial grace,
Filling our hearts with wonder and embrace.
